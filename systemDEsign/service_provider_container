Got it — let’s use Router service instead of Payment so you can see how a real Laravel core service works.

Scenario: How Laravel handles the Router Service
Step 1 — The Service (Router)
Laravel has a class that handles all route registration and matching:

📍 Location in Laravel:

swift
Copy
Edit
vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Routing/Router.php
This is the Router service — it has methods like:

php
Copy
Edit
$router->get('/users', [UserController::class, 'index']);
$router->post('/users', [UserController::class, 'store']);
Step 2 — The Service Provider (Registers Router into Container)
Laravel binds this service in its Routing Service Provider:

📍 vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Routing/RoutingServiceProvider.php

php
Copy
Edit
public function register()
{
    $this->app->singleton('router', function ($app) {
        return new Router($app['events'], $app);
    });
}
$this->app → the service container.

.singleton() → tells the container to only make one instance of Router.

'router' → the binding name you can use to resolve it.

Step 3 — The Service Container (Resolves it)
When your Laravel app boots:

RoutingServiceProvider runs.

It tells the container: “When someone asks for 'router', make a Router object with $app['events'] and $app.”

The container stores this binding.
